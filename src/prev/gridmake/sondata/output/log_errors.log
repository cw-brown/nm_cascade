Run 1:  Wed Feb 19 14:11:05 2025.  .
        Em version 18.54 (64-bit Windows) on DESKTOP-0JJSHOJ local.

  Project:  C:\Users\caleb\Documents\UGResearch\nm_cascade\src\gridmake\output.son.

    Begin electromagnetic simulation using frequency sweep:
      Linear Start = 1, Stop = 4, Number = 100 GHZ, Adaptive

    Frequency:  1 GHZ

      Sonnet Warning:
      Adaptive band synthesis.
      Primary structure has potential box resonances.
      ABS may require large number of discrete frequencies for convergence.
